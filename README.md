# Predicting Daily Rainfall in Australia 

DSCI 525 (Web and Cloud Computing) Group 20

## Project goal

In this project, we will build and deploy ensembles machine learning models in the cloud to predict the daily rainfall in Australia
on a large dataset (approximately 12 GB). The [rainfall dataset](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Daily_rainfall_over_NSW_Australia/14096681) 
contains daily rainfall data from 1889 to 2014 in New South Wales,
Australia. Outputs of complex climate models are features, and the actual rainfall observation is the target. 
During this project, firstly, we need to get the data from the web using API and be familiar with advanced file formats. 
Secondly, we need to set up the infrastructure in the cloud for processing the data. 
Thirdly, we need to set up the distributed infrastructure (Spark) in the cloud and build a machine learning model. 
Finally, at the end of the project, the machine learning model we deployed in the cloud can be used for other consumers.
